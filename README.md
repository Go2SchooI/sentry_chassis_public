RoboMaster2023 heu sentry robot chassis.

I created this repository for the interview. 

This is a project for the embedded system of sentry robot chassis and it implemented functions including state machine based autonomous decision making and chassis control. But the code for localization and route planning is not here.

The main body of the code is in the Application folder and Chassis.c is responsible for the most function. 

Because of the limited preparation time for the competition and the fact that I am not majoring in software engineering, there are many things about this code that are not programmable.
